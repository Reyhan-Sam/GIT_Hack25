                        This resource helps with that so you can see how these things could affect your life, leading
                        to hopefully better decisions than automatically clicking the accept button.

                        These could create problems in the future but it is not certain, so it depends on your opinion about the 
                        circumstance. We want you to have all the information you need.

                        Thus, FinePrint will also help in indicating the positives (hence, the green flags) of each company,
                        so you get to weigh the positives and the negatives. The decision is up to you!

                    <p>Our AI model uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) to analyse the uploaded document sentence by sentence, 
                        provide a summary, and categorise information into the three different categories that were mentioned
                        above: Red Flag, Yellow Flag, and Green Flag.

                    <p>The AI model was trained manually, using test data which consisted of sentences containing common clauses 
                        and keywords found in contracts; using sentences from each of our categories, we trained the model to 
                        accurately recognise and classify sentences.

                         clauses outlined in the contract. It uses easy-to-understand language in order to ensure our user is able

                         friendly, ensuring our users have an efficient and seamless experience.
